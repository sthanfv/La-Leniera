# **App Name**: La Leñera

## Core Features:

- Animated Fire Background: Uses Canvas and requestAnimationFrame to create a subtle, animated fire effect in the background.
- Pack Selection: Allows users to select one of three pre-defined packs (Pa’l Asado, Medio Viaje, Viaje Full) using Alpine.js for state management.
- Location Input: An input field where users can type their neighborhood; validates that the input has at least 4 characters.
- CTA Button with Animation: A prominent 'COTIZAR AHORA' button that displays a 'calculating' animation upon click.
- WhatsApp Redirection: After a 1.5-second delay, redirects the user to WhatsApp (wa.me) with a pre-filled message based on selected pack, neighborhood, and time-based greeting.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated orange (#FF8C00) to represent fire and energy, fitting with the 'La Leñera' theme.
- Background color: Dark, desaturated brown (#0A0806) to provide contrast and evoke a feeling of warmth from a fire.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFB347), for highlighting key elements and calls to action, drawing the user's eye.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and readable look suitable for both headings and body text.
- Center the poster card on the screen to focus user attention. Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Subtle scaling animation on the CTA button to draw the eye. Implement a 'calculating' animation to provide feedback on button click.
